# RagHackathon

## Introduction
Welcome to the RagHackathon project! This project was developed as part of the RagHackathon event, aimed at get familiar with RAG.
The goal of this project is to understand RAG and implement it. By leveraging LLM capabilities, we aim to get the most accurate solution to our queries.

We hope this project will inspire someone who doesn't know where to start and who is a complete beginner to RAG, afterall every tool we are using in this project id free of cost so that we can onboard all.

## Features
This project uses Ollama LLMs since it is free of cost and can run on your local machine even if you don't have a GPU. 
We will be using PostgreSQL and pgvector for vector Database funtionalities.
And Streamlit for deploying our project on web. (Note that all this is free)
